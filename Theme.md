Yes, image processing can involve the use of numerical interpolation, numerical integration, and nonlinear systems of equations, depending on the specific tasks and techniques employed.

1. Numerical Interpolation: Image interpolation techniques are commonly used in image processing to estimate pixel values at locations between known pixels. Interpolation methods such as nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, and spline interpolation can be employed to upscale or resample images, fill in missing data, or generate smooth transitions between pixels.

2. Numerical Integration: Image processing techniques may require numerical integration for various purposes, such as calculating the average intensity or computing statistics within image regions. Integration can also be used in techniques like histogram equalization or to estimate parameters in mathematical models applied to images.

3. Nonlinear Systems of Equations: Nonlinear systems of equations can arise in image processing algorithms that involve solving optimization problems, such as image restoration, image registration, or image segmentation. These problems often require finding solutions that minimize an objective function or satisfy certain constraints, and iterative methods like Newton's method or gradient-based optimization techniques are commonly employed to solve such systems.

It's important to note that the specific application and algorithm used in image processing will determine whether numerical interpolation, numerical integration, or nonlinear systems of equations are utilized. Different techniques may have different requirements and employ various mathematical tools to achieve the desired image processing goals.
