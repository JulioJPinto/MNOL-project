Yes, numerical integration, numerical interpolation, and nonlinear systems are commonly used in various aspects of image processing. Here's a brief explanation of how each of these concepts is applied:

Numerical Integration: Numerical integration techniques, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, can be used in image processing for tasks like calculating the area under a curve or integrating a function over a specific region. For example, in image analysis, numerical integration can be employed to estimate the brightness or color distribution within a region of interest in an image.

Numerical Interpolation: Interpolation is the process of estimating values between known data points. In image processing, numerical interpolation techniques are used to fill in missing or incomplete image data, generate smooth transitions between pixels, or resize images. Common interpolation methods include bilinear interpolation, bicubic interpolation, and spline interpolation. These methods help in improving the visual quality of images, especially when scaling or rotating them.

Nonlinear Systems: Nonlinear systems can arise in various image processing tasks, particularly in image enhancement, image restoration, and computer vision applications. Nonlinear filters and operations are designed to capture and manipulate complex relationships between image pixels. Examples include median filtering, which is effective in reducing salt-and-pepper noise, and non-local means filtering, which preserves image details while denoising. Additionally, nonlinear systems can be utilized in advanced techniques like image segmentation, object recognition, and image registration, where the relationships between pixels or regions are inherently nonlinear.

These numerical techniques play significant roles in improving image quality, extracting relevant information, and enabling advanced image processing algorithms in various domains such as medical imaging, satellite imagery, computer graphics, and more.
