### Problem: Nonlinear Image Smoothing using Numerical Integration and Nonlinear Systems of Equations

### Conditions:
You are tasked with developing an algorithm for nonlinear image smoothing using both numerical integration techniques and nonlinear systems of equations. The goal is to enhance the visual quality of digital images by reducing noise and preserving important details, while simultaneously minimizing blurring artifacts.

1. Input Image: You are given a grayscale digital image of size M x N, represented as a matrix I, where each element I(i, j) represents the intensity value at pixel (i, j). The intensity values range from 0 to 255, with 0 being black and 255 being white.

2. Nonlinear Smoothing Function: The image smoothing algorithm should employ a nonlinear smoothing function F(I) that is applied to each pixel in the image. This function should consider the local neighborhood of each pixel to determine the smoothed intensity value. The specific form of the function can be chosen based on your design considerations, such as the desired trade-off between noise reduction and edge preservation.

3. Numerical Integration: To compute the smoothed intensity value for each pixel, you will utilize numerical integration techniques. This involves approximating the integral of the nonlinear smoothing function F(I) over the local neighborhood of each pixel. You can choose a suitable numerical integration method, such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, to perform the integration.

4. Nonlinear Systems of Equations: In addition to numerical integration, the algorithm will use nonlinear systems of equations to refine the smoothed intensity values. This step will help improve the accuracy and quality of the smoothing process. The nonlinear systems of equations can be solved iteratively using numerical methods like Newton's method or the Gauss-Seidel method.

5. Neighborhood Definition: The local neighborhood for each pixel should be defined as a square or circular region centered at the pixel location. The size of the neighborhood, denoted by k, should be configurable and determined based on your experimental requirements.

6. Boundary Handling: When computing the smoothed intensity values near the image boundaries, you need to handle the edge cases appropriately. You can choose to either ignore the boundary pixels, extend the image using suitable boundary extension methods (e.g., mirror reflection or zero-padding), or use any other boundary handling technique of your choice.

7. Iterative Smoothing: To achieve effective image smoothing, you may need to apply the nonlinear smoothing function F(I), numerical integration, and the nonlinear systems of equations iteratively. The number of iterations, denoted by T, should be configurable and determined based on your experimental requirements.

8. Evaluation Metrics: You should evaluate the performance of your algorithm using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). These metrics will help you quantify the quality of the smoothed image compared to the original image and other existing smoothing techniques.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. Preprocess the input image: If necessary, apply suitable preprocessing techniques to enhance the image quality and remove any unwanted artifacts or noise.

2. Initialize the smoothed image: Create a new matrix S of the same size as the input image I to store the smoothed intensity values.

3. Perform iterative smoothing:

   a. Set the current smoothed image S(t) as the input image I for the first iteration (t = 0).
   
   b. For each pixel (i, j) in the input image I:
   
      i. Define the local neighborhood of size k centered at pixel (i, j).
      
      ii. Use numerical integration to approximate the integral of the nonlinear smoothing function F(S(t)) over the neighborhood
