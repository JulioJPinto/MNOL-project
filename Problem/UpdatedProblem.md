Problem: Denoising and Upscaling Low-Quality Digital Photographs

Conditions:
You are a software engineer at a digital photography company. Your company has recently developed a new camera model that captures images with high resolution but suffers from noise and low quality in certain conditions. To address this issue, you are tasked with implementing an image processing algorithm to denoise and upscale these low-quality digital photographs, improving their overall visual appearance.

1. Input: The user is prompted to enter the filename of the low-quality digital photograph they want to enhance.

2. Reading the original image: The code reads the image file specified by the user.

3. Denoising: The low-quality image contains noise, which affects its visual quality. The code applies a Gaussian filter with a specific standard deviation to remove the noise and improve image clarity.

4. Upscaling: The low-quality image is upscaled by a given scale factor using bicubic interpolation. This step increases the resolution of the image, making it appear more detailed and visually appealing.

5. Smoothing: After upscaling, the code applies a smoothing operation using numerical integration and a Gaussian filter to further enhance the image's visual quality. This step helps reduce artifacts and enhances overall smoothness.

6. Display and Save: The code displays the original low-quality image, the upscaled image, the smoothed image, and the final median-filtered image. Additionally, it saves the upscaled, smoothed, and median-filtered images as separate files for further analysis or usage.

7. Image Size Information: The code provides information about the sizes of the original image, upscaled image, smoothed image, and median-filtered image, allowing users to assess the impact of the image processing pipeline on the dimensions of the images.

By following this image processing pipeline, the code aims to enhance low-quality digital photographs, improving their visual quality, reducing noise, and increasing their resolution for a better viewing experience.
